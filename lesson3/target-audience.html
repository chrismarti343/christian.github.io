        <div class = 'text'>
        <p>
            The target audience in this web site is designed for traveler people and families every day. Have you ever happen that you are planning a trip to a specific place, and need quick information about the weather of my destination? So, most of the time including me. I would go to a weather forecast 
            web site to be prepared or to change our trip travel day, or only to be prepared for the day.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            This web page will be helpful for young couple travelers, families, and groups of friends. They are more
            likely to look on the internet for the forecast before travel and before leaving the house.

            <h3>Two personas</h3>
        </div>

        <div class = 'text'>

            <ul><li><h4>First person : BYUI students | Jhon Stones</h4>
            <p>They will be using this web page because students are more likely to go on a round trip with their friends. </p>
            <p>Students also are more likely to use their cellphone and browse from the cellphone. Since the app is responsive it is going to be because
                way easier to pull up their phones and lookup for this theclimatetoday.com
            </p>
            <p> They are around 18 - 30 years old. Their education level is obviously college students. Since they are looking for getting fast and 
                efficient information on the web sites, this web site will be very helpful for them.
            </p>
        </li></ul>

        <div class ='imageconf'> 
            <img class='domain' src="images/students.jpg" alt="Button own today">
        </div>

        <ul><li><h4>Second person : Families | Jonathan Williams</h4>
            <p>They will be using this web page because many families plan a trip for vacations, also many families, especially the head of the family is the one in charge of taking care of the other family members. So that implies they will be always prepared to support their children
                whether if they go on a vacation and the weather is very bad to they go out. </p>
            <p> This group of people is from 5 years old to 45 years old. This group of people is a little bit wide. However, the head of the family is the most likely
                people to use this web site. 
            </p>
            <p> They will use this web site more than the students because the family depends every day on this information. On weekdays the head of the family 
                can take a quick glance at the web page, and on the weekend since many families plan their next week on Saturdays or Sundays so they will use the web site a little 
                longer than on weekdays.
