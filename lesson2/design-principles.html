            <p>
                The handle of the white space on this web page is perfect, as we can see 
                it looks like a slide sheet, every slide sheet is separated by white space so 
                we can suppose that is another topic.
            </p>
            Also, we can see that the headers are properly spaced with the little text below these.
            <p>
            </p>
            There is no inappropriate white space between head title and text, which make 
            way easier to navigate through the page and get what we are looking for on the page.
            <p>

        <div class="column">
                <div class = 'tilte'>
                    <h2>PARC: Alignment</h2>
                    <h3><a href ='https://www.progressive.com/'>progressive.com</a></h3>
                    
                </div>

            <hr>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>
                    Even though we see the web page is a little simple from my point of view,
                    Alignment is well handled on this webpage. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The header is centered, and the images inside the boxes are centered as well.
                    I can see that the developer make a change with the footer part. This part is 
                    aligned to the left. Most of the web pages I have seen usually centered the footer 
                    on the web page. However, I think it looks good to make a difference with the text above.
                
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                    The last part of this web page is also looking good since there is a lot of text aligned to the left as a common document. 
                   
                </p>
                </div>
        </div>
            
            <div class="column" >
                <div class = 'tilte'>
                    <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
                    <h3> <a href ='https://www.netflix.com/'>netflix.com</a></h3>
                </div>
                <div class ='imageconf'> 
            <img class='bluehost' src="netflix.jpg" alt="Button own today">
        </div>
            <hr>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>
                    This page definitely is the best example of contrast that I could ever find.
                    Since I get into this webpage I can see notable contrast between letter and I
                    the background.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The contrast color makes me feel when I am getting into a theater room. Truly, 
                    the designer created visual interest with this contrast of white and black.

                
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                    There is also an extra color on this web page. The color red on the bottom 
                    makes it even easier to interact with the page. It does perfect work of separate only text with 
                    interactive buttons.
