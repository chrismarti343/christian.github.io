                The handle of the white spece in this web page is perfect, as we can see 
                it is look as slidesheet, every slidesheet is separated by a white space so 
                we can seupose that is other topic.
            </p>
                Also we can see that the header or bigger tittles are propertly spaced with the
                little text below these.
            <p>
            </p>
                There is no unapropiate white space beetween head tittle and text, which make 
                way easier to navigate through the page and get what we are looking for.
            <p>

                <p>
                    Eventhough we see the web page is a little simple from my point of view,
                    Aligment is well handle in this webpage. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The header is centered and the iamges inside the boxes are centered as well.
                    I can see that the developer make a change with the footer part. This part is aligned 
                    to the left. Most of the web pages I ahve seen they usually centered the footer on the 
                    web page. However I think it looks good to make a difference with the text above.

                
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                    The last part of this web page is also looking good, sonce there is a lot of text they aligned 
                    to the left as a common document. 
                   
                </p>
                </div>

                    <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
                    <h3> <a href ='https://www.netflix.com/'>netflix.com</a></h3>
                </div>
                <div class ='imageconf'> 
            <img class='bluehost' src="netflix.jpg" alt="Button own today">
        </div>
            <hr>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>
                    This page definetily is the best example of contrasting that I could find.
                    Since I get into this webpage I can see notable contrast between letter and I
                    the back ground.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The constrast color makes me feel when I am gettin into a theater room. Truly the designer 
                    created a visual interest with tis contrast white and black.

                
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                    There is also an extra color in this web page. The color red on the botton makes even 
                    easier to interat with the page. It does perfect work of separate only text with 
                    interactive bottons.
